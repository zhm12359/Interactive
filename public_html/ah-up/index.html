            <h2>Introduction:</h2>
            <p>Ah-Up is a voice-controlled game inspired by other vertical platformers like Doodle Jump. In Ah-Up, you
                take control of rocket and use your voice to propel it upwards while grabbing coins and avoiding
                obstacles. You can play the game on the left (if you don't see it, make sure you're using HTTPS).
            </p>
            <h2>How to Play:</h2>
            <p>In regular mode (pressing ‘S’ in the start screen), you can use the A and D keys to move left and right,
                but you need to use your voice to make the rocket move up and down. In cheat mode (pressing ‘C’ in the
                start screen), you can just use the WASD keys to control the rocket in addition to your voice. The goal
                of the game is to fly as high as possible while avoiding comets, collecting coins, and making sure not
                to fall under the Danger Line. It’s a great stress reliever because it makes use of your desperate
                screams. It’s also fun to play with your friends, which you can do constructively (both of you trying to
                win), or destructively (having your friend try and sabotage you by yelling).
            </p>
            <h2>Implementation Details:</h2>
            <p>For this project, we defined several classes: Rocket, Coin, Obstacle, Particle, etc. For collisions, we
                used the extremely useful library, <a href="https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D">p5.collide2D</a>
                (we recommend anyone who needs collision detection in their project to use this library, it's super
                easy).
            </p>
            <h3>Background scrolling:</h3>
            <p>We used a very long picture for our background and just scrolled it down during the game play. When it
                runs out, it just loops back to initial state.
            </p>
            <h3>Particle System:</h3>
            <p>For this, we made a Particle class. In its constructor, you can specify its x-position, y-position, and
                whether the particle should fall up or down. The particles also reduce their opacity over time. Whenever
                a particle goes out of bounds or its opacity reaches 0, it is removed in order to save memory.
            </p>
            <h3>Animation:</h3>
            <p>
                Here we made use of a separate game state. In this state, we continued to draw the coins and obstacles
                as normal, but we removed the collision and voice detection for the rocket in order to make it fall, and
                rotated it to make it seem like it was spinning out of control.
            </p>
            <h2>Moving Forward:</h2>
            <p>
                Both of us are not designers, so given more time we would've liked to improve our UI and add custom
                assets/animations for the various objects in our game. Another idea that we wanted to incorporate was to
                use the voice recognition library in p5. One idea was for the user to say "save me" in order to continue
                playing, or saying "shoot" in order to destroy obstacles. We also thought about using cookies to save
                high scores. Of course, if we had time we could also run a backend DB to store user score data.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges:</h2>
            <p>
                Our first challenge came very early on. Although the rocket moves upwards, we found it easier to make
                everything fall downwards instead. A second challenge was collision detection, which we solved through
                the use of <a href="https://github.com/bmoren/p5.collide2D">p5.collide2D</a>. The death animation was
                also a challenge (though more annoying than challenging) as we had to add an additional state to the
                game.
