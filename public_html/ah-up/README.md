# Midterm Project: Ah-Up
Hanming Zeng and Herbert Li

### Basic Idea:
Ah-Up is a game where you use your voice to fly a rocket without hitting any obstacles!
As long as you hold your voice, the rocket will continue to fly.

### Inspiration:
We initially wanted to do something like Doodle Jump, but when
we saw that you could capture sound in p5, we decided that we wanted to integrate
some sort of microphone capture into our game.
